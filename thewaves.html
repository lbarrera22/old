<h2><em>The Waves</em> Crashing Down</h2>

<img src="images/waves.jpg" alt="Laura Barrera" style="width:100%; height:300px"/>

<p><em>The Waves</em> is known as the most difficult of Virginia Woolf’s works. Her husband, Leonard Woolf, declared it a masterpiece as well as the best of her books but added that the novel was extremely difficult and doubted the common reader would be able to follow. Woolf envisioned <em>The Waves</em> as “an abstract, mystical eyeless book: a play poem,” claiming she was “writing to a rhythm and not to a plot.” The ambivalence of <em>The Waves</em> is what makes the novel a difficult read, requiring the reader to remain actively engaged in the writing despite the absence of conventional form and structure. </p>

<p><em>The Waves</em> is, in its simplest conception, a narration of the lives of six friends (Neville, Rhoda, Susan, Bernard, Louis, Jinny) from childhood into adulthood, containing interludes describing the sun at various points in the day. The novel’s first interlude begins with “The sun had not yet risen. The sea was indistinguishable from the sky…” (3) and the last with “Now the sun had sunk. Sky and sea were indistinguishable” (175). In between first and last, we find seven interludes describing the sun going from rising to falling, also padded by vivid descriptions of the sea and the nature all around it. The interludes are described in a manner where humans seem to be altogether absent from the world. An interesting exercise by Woolf: attempting to describe the natural world using language but without imposing human consciousness upon it. The interludes contrast sharply with the sections in between, where all of them, except the last, consist of each friend speaking, but never to each other. The structure of the writing becomes that of soliloquies following one after the other.</p>

<p>On the second to last section—the sun setting, red and gold shooting through the waves—we are received by Bernard, announcing that he is at Hampton Court, where all six of the friends will be convening for the first time since Percival’s dinner party. Each character awaits the entrance of the other, calling out judgments similar to those in the last gathering, but this time Percival is no longer in attendance. The sense of loss is apparent in every character. But it’s not just Percival that they’re grieving (and the sense of security he seemed to have established in all of them). It’s also the loss of their youth that each character is coming to terms with as they sit in a setting that reminds them of their younger and more innocent days. </p>

<p>The tension is subdued on page 165 where the characters all fall into silence: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Drop upon drop” said Bernard, “silence falls” […] “As silence falls, I am dissolved utterly and become featureless and scarcely to be distinguished from another.”</p>

<p>“In this silence,” said Susan, “it seems as if no leaf would ever fall, or bird fly.”</p>

<p>“As if the miracle had happened” said Jinny, “and life were stayed here and now.”</p>

<p>“And” said Rhoda, “we had no more to live.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The silence evolves into a trance-like state, according to Bernard. Each character moving closer to another, asking for support, and speaking in a language of lovers, as Woolf likes to call it. What struck me as significant about this scene is how it is one of the very few moments throughout the entirety of <em>The Waves</em> where a feeling is captured by a single word: silence.  I thought that either silence, or that particular silence Woolf pictured, cannot be captured in any other way than through the word itself which highlights the limit of language, or its power? It’s hard to tell which, but the moment was an interesting contrast to the rest of the book, where nearly every sentence engages in the work of capturing emotion using language, in a long-winded, flowery manner.</p>

<p>Even more interesting is the effect pure silence has on each character. The silence appears to momentarily absorb each person’s concerns related to fighting off the weight of existence. This suggests that perhaps much of our discontents in life are tied to language and how it functions in us, or that meaning making is purely a matter of how we mold language. <em>The Waves</em>, I gathered, seems to show that feelings support thoughts, and thoughts support feelings. Each pursuing the other endlessly.</p>

<p>In the last section of <em>The Waves</em>, the sun has sunk; the sea is indistinguishable from the sky. Bernard, while having dinner with an acquaintance, is the only one speaking. His voice takes on a grandiose, yet anxious ridden tone. Bernard claims he will explain the meaning of his life, but readily admits “…in order to make you understand, to give you my life, I must tell you a story—and there are so many, and so many—stories of childhood, stories of school, love, marriage, death, and so on; and none of them are true…How tired I am of stories, how tired I am of phrases that come down beautifully with all their feet on the ground! (178).</p>

<p>My first impression of Bernard’s soliloquy was that in was an aesthetic choice, rather than one seeking to profess some sort of truth. In the last section, we gather Bernard is struggling to remain grounded, stating in various parts of the section as a reassurance that “Life is pleasant, life is good; after Monday comes Tuesday, and Wednesday follows Tuesday”  but admits that he cannot make sense of his life without the involvement of other people.  “… if I meet an unknown person, and try to break off, here at this table, what I call “my life,” it is not one life that I look back upon; I am not one person; I am many people; I do not altogether know who I am—Jinny, Susan, Neville, Rhoda, or Louis: or how to distinguish my life from theirs” (205). Earlier in the soliloquy, he mentioned: “Louis was disgusted by the nature of human flesh; Rhoda by our cruelty; Susan could not share; Neville wanted order; Jinny love; and so on. We suffered terrible as we became separate bodies” (179)</p>

<p>After being told repeatedly Bernard’s need for other people in making sense of his life, particularly his five childhood friends, it is hard to imagine anyone else concluding <em>The Waves</em>. The choice of having only one-person speaking is, I believe, meant to call out the subjective nature of the human experience, as most readers wonder what the other characters had to say. But the choice of Bernard in particular I found to be the most fitting, as he is the one that feels the most “whole” or “complete” when he is with the group of friends. </p>
