  <div class="introduction">
    <p>Hi, I am Laura. I've always wished to have a simple, straight to the point manner in which I could introduce myself but, to be sincere, I am incapable of choosing. It seems that the more I live, the more I realize that what I find most fulfilling is to be always exploring, searching for new ways to see the world. </p>

    <p>Maybe that's why I love stories, and complex ones in particular, because they defy systemization. Also maybe why I love visual art,
    because our perception is an equation of timing and location, of all scales,
    and the effect relayed upon us is always in flux.</p>

    <p>In simple terms, I am an artist, though I lack an art degree or any serious art credential. I do have 11 (& counting) paintings under my name. I am also an intellectual, though the term lands weirdly on me since I never take myself too seriously.</p>

    <p>But if you insist in wanting to know more about me other than these broad claims, then here you go: I am Colombian-born, lived in Santiago, Chile for eight years, and moved to
      south Florida at age 11, where I stayed until I went away to college. At Cornell, I majored in Industrial and Labor Relations, minored in English
      and took classes in a variety of subjects in a myriad of departments because I figured when else would I get the spectacular chance to fulfill this endless curiosity that drives me!

    <p>In any way, I hope you enjoy the content. If you have any comments or feedback or questions (or concerns),
    please feel free to message me...anywhere. I love to chat.</p>

  <p>Laura</p>
