<h2>Poetry as a Political Force</h2>

<img src="images/politicalpoetry.jpg" alt="Laura Barrera" style="width:100%; height:300px"/>

<p>The connection between poetry and politics can perhaps be best discussed by first considering the relationship between the personal and the political. Although a complex subject, influenced by a multitude of factors, the conclusion I have drawn is the political is always personal. But is the inverse also true? Is the personal always political? I believe this is what poetry, political poetry, tries to accomplish. Through its succinct form, ambiguity, and commitment to emotional engagement, poetry captures all. It instills in its readers a greater awareness, or a desire to become more aware, to then understand, explain, and deconstruct the already settled. In times of political turmoil, when the exterior chaos seeps into our psyches, we turn to art for support, for therapy. We often hope for it to tell us how we should live. </p>

<p><em>Purgatory</em> is a collection of poems written by Chilean poet Raul Zurita. The poems stem from the day of Pinochet’s coup, where Zúrita was arrested and tortured. The poems are rather strange. They are striking and confusing, personal and distant. As a reader, I feel an oscillation between remoteness and closeness. Yet, the clearest binding force to them all is the concept of pain. In the preface, Zúrita confesses: “It is difficult for me to comment on my own work, but I feel like <em>Purgatory</em> represents a certain image of what pain can generate, of its desperation, but also, I hope, of its beauty.” If there’s a certainty that <em>Purgatory</em> can capture, or represent, is that there is none. His memory fails him, and he fails himself, and from total wreckage, total loss, <em>Purgatory</em> is Zúrita’s attempt at living, once again.</p>

<p>The book begins with the following poem: “my friends think//I am a sick woman// because I burned my left cheek.” Earlier in the preface, Zúrita explains that the idea of <em>Purgatory</em> began with this very act, for “When faced with horror, we had to respond with art that was stronger and more vast than the pain and damage inflicted on us.”  This act, in particular, had occurred to him after he recalled the New Testament phrase: “if someone strikes your right cheek, turn the other to him.” Whether the act of self-harm was a calculated artistic performance to exemplify non-violent resistance while also maintaining that violence is often internalized, or whether it was because self-harm can offer us a sense of control or make emotional pain more tangible, it nonetheless turns the deeply personal into a political matter. The public display of his self-mutilated face begs us to question in what kind of state must a person be where the idea of voluntarily burning one’s face can be considered, or even desired. Later in the book, we find a note from a psychologist stating that Raul Zurita’s most probable diagnosis is an “epileptic psychosis”; his name is scratched out, next to it we find written: “/Violeta/Sweet Beatriz/Rosamunda/Manuela” and at the bottom of the page “OVE YOU I LOVE YOU INFINITELY L.” It is through poems like these that as readers we are submerged into the Pinochet dictatorship, where we then attempt to imagine the trauma thousands faced and then contend with the silence that has become of it. Unlike using statistics, or detailed descriptions of the horrific acts committed, <em>Purgatory</em> captures dictatorships’ most intimate effects on the population: it captures the despair, the tremendous loss, and the madness. It is no longer reduced to an unfortunate event, or as the failings or shortcomings of governments or politics, but as a pain, a psychic pain, that few can comprehend. </p>

<p>Bolaño’s <em>By Night in Chile</em> has a related effect, though perhaps more perplexing intellectually than emotionally. The book begins as the narrator, Sebastian Urrutia Lacroix, or Father Ibacache, lies on his death bed. Overcome with an anxiety that is palpable yet unimaginable as few of us can empathize with such a proximity to death, he begins to tell his story; the story of a Chilean priest, poet and literary critic. Blaming the “wizened youth” for his sudden loss of peace, he is compelled to clear up a “couple of points” about his life. With a commitment to take full responsibility over his words and silences, he rummages through his memories, seeking peace, or, as we will later learn, forgiveness. The fallibility and ephemerality of memory is a common subject throughout the book, and so too the sense that he is desperately trying to find a way to tell his story accurately. He mentions how “sometimes I even forget my own name (3)”, how “it is something my memory has not retained” (5) and how “my memory is failing me” (6). At other instances, we gather a voracious self-awareness, “...and then I thought, or maybe the thought has only occurred to me now, that life is a succession of misunderstandings” (4). These moments of sincerity make Urrutia Lacroix seem, initially, like a man of integrity, a trusted source. </p>

<p>The central theme of <em>By Night in Chile</em> doesn’t become clear until Father Ibacache comes back from Europe on the reasoning that it was time he fulfilled his duty as a Chilean. The political situation in Chile seems to worsen after Allende is elected. Then the coup d’état happens, Allende commits suicide, and Pinochet becomes President. Father Ibacache marks the following days as if everyone had been plunged into a dream, and this is where he concludes that the pinnacle of the dream world’s existence is the following: “Anything can happen and whatever happens, the dreamer accepts it” (76). The disconnection, lack of sense, loss of self, Urrutia Lacroix recounts of that period parallels that of Zurita in <em>Purgatory</em>. However, not having been a direct victim of violence, protected by his status as priest, Sebastian Urrutia Lacroix’s main source of trauma (if it can be considered that) is due to actions that could make him an accomplice of Pinochet. But Ibacache rationalizes his way out, tries to maintain that he is, after all, a good man. He reassures himself that teaching Pinochet and his junta Marxism doesn’t mean much, for in the grand scope of things, it might have “altered the order of the factors but not the product,” never the product.</p>

<p>From here on we begin to grow distrustful of Father Ibacache, although personally I managed to gather a bit of sympathy for him, maybe saying no was not an option and there is a peculiar attractiveness to meeting Pinochet. But if history has taught us anything, if it has repeatedly shown us anything, is how the minimal contributions, or complicities, of many is what leads to widespread oppression and injustice. Ibacache seems to be screaming at us at this point, pleading us to believe that it truly does not matter, that radicals and fascists are one and the same, that he taught Marxism to a student, not a dictator. Pinochet learned Marxism to expand his mind, not his powers, of course. But as we continue reading, we become apparent of a greater lesson at play. </p>

<p>We thus enter the world of the intellectual elite in Chile. We are invited into Maria Canales’ house, where Chile’s artists and intellectuals would meet during Pinochet’s regime. Here, Ibacache takes on the moral high ground, claiming that his visits, in all honesty and in comparison, to other writers, were truly rare, and although he perceived certain wrongdoings when he attended, he simply had no concrete evidence to form any valid accusations. Months later after attending his last soirée, a friend told him a story, one few thought they knew but really nearly all knew, that in Maria Canales’ basement there was a metal bed where her husband, Jimmie Thompson, who was actually a key agent of the DINA, would interrogate, torture, and sometimes occasionally kill prisoners. Why didn’t anybody speak out? They were afraid. Father Ibacache says he wouldn’t have been afraid. He would have said something, but he just found out too late. By the time he knew, everything had already settled, and for what reason would he go around stirring up the settled? </p>

<p>But isn’t this what writers, artists, poets, are supposed to do? Deconstruct, show the hidden, criticize? Urrutia Lacroix, on his deathbed, recognizes this. The wizened youth has shown it to him and it has disturbed his peace. Now, he is trying to contend. “That is how literature is made” he says, there is not much that can be done, there is no solution. The wizened youth disagrees, there must be a solution, there must, but Urrutia Lacroix disagrees. The literary world does not believe in accountability or integrity, they believe in upholding images and statuses and appearances. So, what then becomes of the public? Where can they learn how to live? Where do they find validation, support, a binding force? Who reminds them of their humanity when those supposed to are too distant? Too up high in the theoretical, in the academia, that they can no longer reach the common people. </p>

<p>Nicanor Parra, the Antipoet of Chile, sought to fix this. His goal was to give poetry back to the people. Stripping the flowery and eloquent language found in traditional poetry, Parra opted for humor, sarcasm, and colloquial language. Regarded as Pablo Neruda’s adversary, Parra sought to distill the “elite elevatedness” out of poetry, aiming instead for a binding force. And what better binding force and coping mechanism is there other than humor? The poems touch the political realm often, indiscreetly but strikingly when noticed. Poems like “Yup” or “Exchanges”, are highly political, but so, so personable due to its wit, carelessness, and brutal honesty. They are poems that when read we laugh or smile rather than dispute. </p>

<p>The effectiveness of antipoems seems to only grow stronger with Visual Artefactos, where discarding sentence structure all together, Parra creates visuals instead, which come to seem more like slogans out of a marketing campaign rather than poetry, but that still hold that poetic effect that is so uniquely indulging. A question worth asking, then, is why is antipoetry such a strong political force? What makes antipoetry so special and effective is that it does not instill a need for the perfect solution or an accurate, all encompassing, explanation—this often leads to divisiveness; antipoetry is simply a commitment to see and tell things exactly as they are. It is empowerment at its finest. </p>
