      <h2>Is Poetry Manipulative?</h2>
      <p>The question of poetry as a manipulative discourse came
        to me as I began to think of poetry as a form of seduction. From its
        conception to subsequent explanations, the purpose of poetry, as articulated
        by Poe in “The Poetic Principle”, is to excite, to elevate the soul...</p></div>

        <h2><em>The Waves</em> Crashing Down</h2>
        <p><em>The Waves</em> is known as the most difficult of Virginia Woolf’s works.
          Her husband, Leonard Woolf, declared it a masterpiece as well as the best of her

          would be able to follow. Woolf envisioned <em>The Waves</em> as...</p>

      <h2>On the Personal Essay</h2>
      <p>On one of my journal entries during my time in Spain, I included the
        reason why I write: I believe that if I put my rummaging thoughts into
        structured sentences that will make them leave me. I seem to be afflicted
        with a habit that is most common amongst writers: I think too much...</p></div>

      <h2><em>Endgame</em> & its Greyness</h2>
      <p>About a third of the way into Beckett’s <em>Endgame</em>, I gave up.
        I surrendered my need to find meaning, to understand, or to decipher,
        the author’s intent in writing. The plot. The personality of the characters.
        None of it followed a scheme. Clov and Hamm, Nell and Glam, they all felt the same to me...</p></div>

      <div class="text">
      <h2>Poetry as a Political Force</h2>
        <p>The connection between poetry and politics can perhaps be best discussed
          by first considering the relationship between the personal and the
          political. Although a complex subject, influenced by a multitude of factors,
          the conclusion I have drawn is the political is always personal... </p></div>
